projection videos from Nano-CT

# Projection Videos by the VAM
I made 3 videos using a real projection image set that has translation and tilt errors.
You can check out the 3 videos below in the "Issues" section.

1. Original projection movie with translation and tilt errors
2. Removed translation errors and determine a tilt type and angle
3. Ideally aligned video by the VAM
